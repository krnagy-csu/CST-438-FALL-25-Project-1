# CST-438-FALL-25-Project-1

Hi! Welcome to our group project. This is Project 1
for CST 438 with Dr. C. Our group is group 15, and consists of members:

Gabe Gallagher, 
Krisztian Nagy, 
Liliana Saavedra, 
Krystelle Barroso, 

This is a React Native app being emulated and tested with Expo.
It's main features will include:

- a local database
- REST API calls
- authenticate users (via local database of usernames and passwords)
- local storage
- display of information

Ideas are still being floated around at this stage of development, 
and a timeline for project milestones to be made each week is in the works. The deadline for this project is September 28th, 2025.

Note: The videos Dr. C released for expo emulation seem a little outdated. To emulate this on your local machine, navigate to the project folder in terminal and run "npx expo start".
