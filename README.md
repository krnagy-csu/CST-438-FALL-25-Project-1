# CST-438-FALL-25-Project-1

Hi! Welcome to our group project. This is Project 1
for CST 438 with Dr. C. Our group is group 15, and consists of members:

Gabe Gallagher, 
Krisztian Nagy, 
Liliana Saavedra, 
Krystelle Barroso, 

This is a React Native app being emulated and tested with Expo.
It's main features will include:

- a local database
- REST API calls
- authenticate users (via local database of usernames and passwords)
- local storage
- display of information

Ideas are still being floated around at this stage of development, 
and a timeline for project milestones to be made each week is in the works. The deadline for this project is September 28th, 2025.

So far we have decided to create a GoodReads clone, where we would allow users to search for books, mark which ones they've read, rate them, save books, and more. 
1.
- Users will be able to login with a username and password on a login page. 
    -If their credentials do NOT 
    exist in the user database, they will be denied access and shown so, then they will be prompted to try again.
    -If the user would like to register into the database, they will be able to clich a button, which will take them to a sign up page, where they can enter a new username and password. If a username already exists, there should be an indicater stating so and they will be prompted to enter a different username. Once signed up, their new inforation should be added to the database and they should be taken back to the login page.
    -If a user enters correct login info, they will be taken to a home page.
    -Once logged in, their username will be displayed in the top right corner. (This could be interactive and take them to their profile (see statement ______))

Note: The videos Dr. C released for expo emulation seem a little outdated. To emulate this on your local machine, navigate to the project folder in terminal and run "npx expo start".
